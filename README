An Investigation Into Emergent Phenomena in Chaotic Systems of Multiple Pendulums

------------------------------

This project numerically solves the system of three 2nd order coupled ODEs that describe the dynamics of three connected pendulums each of equal length and mass.

The analysis is done using the Leapfrog Methods
