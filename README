An Investigation Into Emergent Phenomena in Chaotic Systems of Multiple Pendulums

------------------------------

This project numerically finds stable solutions the system of three 2nd order 
coupled ODEs that describe the dynamics of three coupled pendulums.

The ODEs are solved for random initial conditions, with the results being
passed into the Pougnet Algorithm for analysis. This algorithm finds repetiton
in the phase space of the system, and if sufficient repetition is found that
set of initial conditions is said to potentially lead to a stable solution.

The solutions that are flagged as being potentially stable are then saved
to a user-defined directory for further analysis.
